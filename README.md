# strings-in-c-pt4
This repo concatenates two strings but based on own logic (not using strcat).
This program prints two strings based on user's input, concatenates the two strings and prints it out to the user. 
It also prints out the lenght of individual string, then sums both lenght together to give a third output that consists of the sum of both strings.
